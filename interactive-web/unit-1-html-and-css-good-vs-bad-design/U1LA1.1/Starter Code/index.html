    Did you know <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet> the official birthday of the internet </a> 
    is January 1st, 1983? Even though it came into existence then, it didn't gain the popularity we know now until at least a decade later, when it became more common to have home computers and home computers with an internet connection. In the year 2000, only 50% of US Adults said they used the internet, and less than 5% of homes had high speed internet access. That means a lot of things we found common place couldn't be done yet! (And without high speed internet, you had to listen to a <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dudJjUU9Nhs> scary sound </a> to get online.)
  
      <h3> Things you couldn't do in 2000:</h3> 
  
          <ul><li>Post a selfie to social media</li><li>Watch Youtube Videos</li><li>Online shop at your favorite store</li></ul> </p>
