      <h2>About Frida</h2>
      <p>
        "Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón" was a Mexican painter known
        for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature
        and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by the country's popular culture, she
        employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity,
        postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frida Kahlo, a Mexican woman who had multiple disabilities including
        polio as a child and spinal and pelvis damage from a car accident,
        became a world-renowned self-portrait painter. She has since served as a
        role model for generations of artists, people with disabilities and
        bisexual women.
